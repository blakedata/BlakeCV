# **Skills Portfolio by Blake Kelly Oates**
## **Personal Projects**
My goal for this repository is to provide a quick overview of my technical skills. I have opted to provide some short analyses that I created by myself, rather than including work such as the famous Kaggle Titanic Dataset :smile: So please consider this to be a "Proof of Competency" rather than an exhaustive showcase of my skills.
### **Exploration and Analysis of Google Merchandise Store (SQL) :heavy_dollar_sign:**

Using a publicly available Google Analytics Dataset I sought to answer questions that I feel replicate the tasks I would need to perform as a data analyst. I also created a slide deck to help further showcase these techniques.

### **How Tackling Affects Premier League Football Performance (Python) :soccer:**
[GitHub Link](https://github.com/blakedata/BlakeCV/blob/093d38019aed589bb7acd868a2601668b7bbe0a5/How%20Tackling%20Affects%20Premier%20League%20Football%20Performance.ipynb).

I wanted to perform an analysis on something I was genuinely interested in so I chose football. A lot of structured data for high level sports is hidden behind paywalls so I collected the data from multiple CSV files for the 22/23 PL season using fbref.com before merging and cleaning the data into one usable CSV file.
I found that there is a negative correlation between tackling and key indicators of positive performance. Wins, Goals and Goal Difference are all seen to react negatively to teams that tackle more.
