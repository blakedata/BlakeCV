I wanted to perform an analysis on something I was genuinely interested in so I chose football. A lot of structured data for high level sports is hidden behind paywalls so I collected the data from multiple CSV files for the 22/23 PL season using fbref.com before merging and cleaning the data into one usable CSV file.
I found that there is a negative correlation between tackling and key indicators of positive performance. Wins, Goals and Goal Difference are all seen to react negatively to teams that tackle more.

### **Exploration and Analysis of Google Merchandise Store (SQL)**


Using a publicly available Google Analytics Dataset I sought to answer questions that I feel replicate the tasks I would need to perform as a data analyst. I also created a simple slide deck to help further showcase these techniques.
