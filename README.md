I wanted to perform an analysis on something I was genuinely interested in. I chose football. I collected data from multiple CSV files for the 22/23 PL season using fbref.com before merging and cleaning the data into one usable CSV file.
I found that there is a negative correlation between tackling and key indicators of positive performance. Wins, Goals and Goal Difference are all seen to react negatively to teams that tackle more.
